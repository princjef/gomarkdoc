    // Changing the header map after a call to WriteHeader (or
    // Write) has no effect unless the modified headers are
    // trailers.
    //
    // There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
    // predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
    // send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
    // trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
    // keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
    // trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
    // keys not known to the Handler until after the first Write,
    // is to prefix the Header map keys with the TrailerPrefix
    // constant value. See TrailerPrefix.
    //
    // To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
    // their value to nil.

    // Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
    //
    // If WriteHeader has not yet been called, Write calls
    // WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
    // does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
    // to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
    // DetectContentType. Additionally, if the total size of all written
    // data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
    // Content-Length header is added automatically.
    //
    // Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
    // Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
    // Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
    // needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
    // headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
    // call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
    // may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
    // handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
    // writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
    // by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
    // possible to maximize compatibility.

    // will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
    // Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
    // send error codes.
    //
    // The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
    // Only one header may be written. Go does not currently

    // Server sends automatically when the Request.Body is read.
